# Vehicle Weighbridge Management System with License Plate Recognition

> **Note**: This project is currently private. Source code is not available at this time.

## 📋 Project Description

This software is a **Windows-based application** developed in **C#** with a **Microsoft SQL Server** database backend.  
It is specifically designed for **vehicle weighbridge management**, featuring an integrated **License Plate Recognition (LPR)** system.

By connecting to **IP cameras** installed at both ends of the weighbridge, the system automatically captures vehicle images, reads license plates, and records them directly in the software.  
The software supports fully automated weight registration for vehicles and their cargo.
